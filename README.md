# Reference Number Generation tooling (fsa-rn)


## About FSA-RN
Tooling and specification to support the generation of Reference Numbers in particular for Food Business Establishment Registration.

### The purpose
The specification provides a standard for the provision of reference numbers.  This would apply to:
- the Food Standards Agency (FSA)
- Local Authorities (that a Food Business Registers with)
- Management Information Systems (MIS) and other Suppliers to Local Authorities  
- Suppliers to the Food Standards Agency

The specification is implimented with specific code that can be run as part of a digital service within one or more of those organisations. The reference numbers provided would be stored in data and provided as a reference number in a digital service at the point of creation.   

### Current development phase
This is in the **Alpha phase** of development.  We use the alpha phase to: build prototypes of our services, test with users and in this case third-party suppliers and to show services are technically possible.

### Tooling implementation
The specification (version 0.1) is implemented initially in java ([java-rn](java-rn) - version 0.0.1) and will have a javascript implementation.  

## Getting started

## Documentation and specification
See the [project Wiki](https://github.com/FoodStandardsAgency/fsa-rn/wiki) for the **specification** and other documentation such as context, rational and detail on the underlying methods.

# Reference Number Generation tooling (fsa-rn)


## About FSA-RN
Tooling and specification to support the generation of Reference Numbers in particular for Food Business Establishment Registration.

### The purpose
The specification and tool is to be used by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) or Local Authorities and their suppliers in providing standardised reference numbers.  These reference numbers would be stored in data and provided as a reference number in a digital service at the point of creation.   

### Current development phase
This is in the **Alpha phase** of development.  We use the alpha phase to: build prototypes of our services, test with users and in this case third-party suppliers and to show services are technically possible.

### Tooling implementation
The specification (version 0.1) is implemented initially in java ([java-rn](java-rn) - version 0.0.1) and will have a javascript implementation.  

## Getting started

## Documentation and specification
See the [project Wiki](https://github.com/FoodStandardsAgency/fsa-rn/wiki) for the **specification** and other documentation such as context, rational and detail on the underlying methods.

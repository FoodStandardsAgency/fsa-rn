# Reference Number Generation tooling (rrn-gen)
Tooling and specification to support the generation of Reference Numbers in particular for Food Business Establishment Registration

## Summary

The tool is to be used by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) or Local Authorities and their suppliers in providing standardised reference numbers.  These reference numbers would be stored in data and provided as a reference number in a digital service at the point of creation.   

This is in the Alpha phase of development.  We use the alpha phase to: build prototypes of our services, test with users and in this case third-party suppliers and to demonstrate services are technically possible.



### Overarching Character Set
For the avoidance of doubt [UTF-8](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3629.txt) is the mandatory characters set for use throughout.  A subset of this character set is used in the encoding process.

## Feedback
We would like to understand and problems with the design or approach that you may have.  Please feedback to: data@food.gov.uk

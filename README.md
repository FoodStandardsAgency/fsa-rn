# Reference Number Generation tooling (fsa-rn)

## About FSA-RN
Tooling and specification to support the generation of Reference Numbers in particular for a Food Business Establishment Registration.

### Purpose
The specification provides a standard for the provision of reference numbers.

The specification is implemented with specific code that can be run as part of a digital service within one or more of those organisations. The reference numbers provided would be stored in data and provided as a reference number in a digital service at the point of creation.

See the [**Rational and overview**](https://github.com/FoodStandardsAgency/fsa-rn/wiki/Rational-and-overview) pages on the [wiki](https://github.com/FoodStandardsAgency/fsa-rn/wiki) for more detail.  

### Current development phase
This is in the **Alpha phase** of development.  We use the alpha phase to: build prototypes of our services, test with users and in this case third-party suppliers and to show services are technically possible.

- `Document Version 0.1` <BR/>
- `Specification Version 0.1` <BR/>

- The initial Java implementation ([java-rn](java-rn) - `Version 0.0.1`)
- A Javascript implementation is planned following initial testing phase

### Documentation and specification
See the [project Wiki](https://github.com/FoodStandardsAgency/fsa-rn/wiki) for the **specification** and other documentation such as context, rational and detail on the underlying methods.


## Getting started
- See the [specification documentation](https://github.com/FoodStandardsAgency/fsa-rn/wiki)
- choose the code implementation (currently java-rn only)
- further details to be added
- note that you will need choose appropriate input parameters for the specific use

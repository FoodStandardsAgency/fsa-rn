# Reference Number Generation tooling (rrn-gen)

## Summary

Tooling and specification to support the generation of Reference Numbers in particular for Food Business Establishment Registration. 

This is currently in the Alpha phase.  We use the alpha phase to: build prototypes of our services, test with users and in this case third-party suppliers and to demonstrate services are technically possible.

**Overarching Character Set:** For the avoidance of doubt UTF-8 is the mandatory characters set for use throughout.  A subset of this is used in the encoding process.



## Feedback

We would like to understand and problems with the design or approach that you may have.  Please feedback to: data@food.gov.uk
